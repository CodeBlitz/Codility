# Fish
An unknown set of fish are moving along a river in linear path either up stream or down stream. As fish come in contact the larger of the two fish will eat the other.
Each fish is either larger or smaller than the other, no two fish are considered equal in size.

## Goal
This program will calculate how many fish are alive after both groups completely pass each other in the river.
